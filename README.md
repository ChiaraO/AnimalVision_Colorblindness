# AnimalVision_Colorblindness
Computational Photography project: Create an app that mimics vision of people with color-blindness in images captured in real-time for the protanopes, deuteranopes, and tritanopes. Also, simulate the vision of four different animals.


AltVis: The Android Project

Created for CS413: Computational Photography at EPFL. 

The application was developped using Android Studio. If you have any problem running it, it might be because some local files are ignored in Github, so you might need to create a new Android Project, add the modified files (the whole app folder), and do not forget to add a new module (openCVLibrary24132), and add it as a dependency to the module app.
